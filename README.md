# DictionaryApp
Requires data.json file, which is provided.
A simple dictionary app in which the script supplies you with the definition of a word you provide. If the word is misspelled or close to something, the script will automatically find the closest key to the word you provided and ask you if you meant something else instead. Ex: you type in "rainn", and the dictionary will ask if you meant "rain" instead and provide you with the definition if you answer yes.
